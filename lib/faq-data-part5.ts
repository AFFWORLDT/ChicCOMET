    question: "What does 'Long Staple Yarn' mean?",
    answer: "Long staple refers to cotton fibers that are longer (typically 1.5 inches or more). Longer fibers create stronger, smoother, and more durable yarns. Our 100% Virgin Cotton Long Staple Yarn produces superior quality with less pilling, better softness, and increased durability compared to short-staple cotton.",

    question: "What is the difference between TC 200, 300, 400, and 600?",
    answer: "Thread Count (TC) indicates threads per square inch. TC 200-210 (Upper Economy) is good quality, TC 300 (Semi Luxury) offers premium comfort, TC 400 (Luxury) provides exceptional softness with fusion details, and TC 600 (Hyper Luxury) represents the ultimate in luxury. Higher TC means finer threads, more luxurious feel, and better durability.",
